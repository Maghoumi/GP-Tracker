Classifier:
	Modifying the claims in now synchronized

GLVisualizerKernel:
	Now appropriately frees all objects

ClassifierSet:
	Now has the "resetClaims" method. This is necessary for a dual card setup
	The getPointerToAll function no longer resets the claims

GLVisualizer:
	Uses both cards to run all classifiers on all segments.
	[ISSUE: will not draw overlay -- this will hopefully be fixed in the next commit]
