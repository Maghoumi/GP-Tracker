Complete code clean-up and change in the way classes work.
Many of the classes have been completely removed
Added CudaPrimitive and CudaPrimitive2D classes that provide wrappers to 1D and 2D CUDA/Java arrays

By adding CudaPrimitive, all allocation/copy/deallocation operations are now encapsulated in the Primitive
classes and the code is much more clean. 

Added the interface ImageFilterProvider. This interface was created for the sole purpose of
	encapsulating image filtering using CUDA.
	
Added the class FilteredImage to simplify the task of representing filtered images in the GP system
		
Added TrainingInstance in order to completely replace the poorly written CudaData and NewCudaData class
Added CudaTrainingInstance which is a CUDA equivalent of the TrainingInstance

Job:
	Added the timestamp field. Now we know exactly when a Job object
	was created.
 
GLVisualizerKernel:
 	Now implements ImageFilterProvider and can filter images
 	
filter.cu:
 	Added pitchInElements to add the support for pitched images
