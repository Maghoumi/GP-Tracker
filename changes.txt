Added the experiment runners
There are lots of useless classes now that are only useful for running automated experiments

Added the session prefix to CudaEvolutionState, GPEngine, Invoker, CudaSimpleStatistics and
	CudaSimpleShortStatistics. With the prefix, many runs of the system are possible and the
	statistics file of each run will have its own unique name.

Added the interfaces SuccessListener and SuccessProvider to facilitate the task of notifying
	an interested party of the conclusion of a successful session.
	
Classifier now clones the passed individual (? necessary??). However, all operations that work
	on the underlying expression of the classifier are now synchronized (this was causing the
	ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in ClassifierSet)

ClassifierSet:
	This class is now a wrapper for TreeSet and is no longer a TreeSet itself. This was done
	because other TreeSet methods need to be synchronized manually and may pose problems if
	the unsynchronized methods are called accidentally.
	This class will also maintain a separate list of the expressions of all individuals when
	getPointerToAll is called ==> this probably fixes the random ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
	in getPointerToAll 

SegmentedVideoFrame:
	Now wraps a List instead of a Set. This way the collection can be shuffled before training.
	This prevents the GP system getting stuck with one texture all the time
	
GLVisualizer:
	The orphan textures now have priority.
	The Garbage textures are now correctly disposed of
	In passNewClassifier the ClassifierCheckBox is now updated properly (before, the list was
	sometimes out of synch with classifiers ==> enability change would not affect anything!)
