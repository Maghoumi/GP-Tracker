Fixes the problem with CudaSimpleStatistics: if other statistic hooks were
added to the system, they were not called because the code that was responsible
to call the child stat hooks was missing.

Job:
	Added the "id" field so that each job can be distinguished uniquely from
	other jobs that are done by the GPSystem.

Added CudaSimpleShortStatistics:
	This stat hook is able to spit out stats per GP job. When a job is queued
	on the system, the job's ID is logged and separated from all other jobs
	that the system has performed.

CudaEvolutionState:
	Fixed the problem with the initial start of the GP system: now the state
	is initialized but the initial population is not created until a job is
	queued on the system -- this fix was necessary for correct operations of
	the CudaSimpleShortStatistics hook
