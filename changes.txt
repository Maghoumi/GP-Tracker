The whole system now uses TransScale for GPU interop
 
Fixes the serious bug with single claimer classifiers. If one segment is uniquely identified
by more than 1 classifier, the older one is deleted

** NOTE: Do thresholding is always performed! (still have no idea how to map an OpenGL buffer
to more than 1 card)
 
CudaEvolutionState:
	Now correctly reports the classifiers every "n" generations
	When reporting classifiers, they are cloned

Classifier:
	Now supports cloning

Segment:
	Each segment now holds a list of all the classifiers that have claimed it
